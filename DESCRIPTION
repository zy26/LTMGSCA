Description: With an inference of the heterogeneous TRS of each gene by the LTMG model, analysis of following problems for a scRNA-seq data, including (1) differentially expressed genes, (2) transcriptional bursts, (3) cell type specific gene regulations, (4) cell type inference, and (5) gene co-regulation module identification, can be formulated and computed by implementing LTMG model with other methods. 
    An R package of LTMG model based single cell RNA-seq analysis tools.
    Specifically, the package includes the fitting of LTMG and LTMG-2LR models for single cell RNA-seq data, LTMG-DEG, LTMG based likelihood assessment, outlier gene and cell identification, identification of phenotypic feature associated TRS, cell type inference, and gene co-regulation module identification.
